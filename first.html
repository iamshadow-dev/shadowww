    <h2>History of computing</h2>

    <h4>Early history</h4>
    So the history of computing starts 5000 years ago with the abacus. It is the earliest known calculating device, and it is still in use today mostly in asia. I am pretty sure that you have at least seen the abacus and some of you might have used it. It typically consists of a rectangular frame with thin parallel rods strung with beads. The abacus assigned different weights to each rod; this scheme allowed a wide range of numbers to be represented by just a few beads. And the beads can be manipulated to perform the common arithmetical operations that are useful for commercial transactions and in bookkeeping.
    <h4>Napier’s logarithms</h4>
    Calculating devices took a different turn when John Napier, a Scottish math-matician, published his discovery of logarithms in 1614. As any person can attest, adding two 10-digit numbers is much simpler than multiplying them together, and the transformation of a multiplication problem into an addition problem is exactly what logarithms enable. This simplification is possible because of the following logarithms property : the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the numbers. By 1624 the logarithm tables were created with 14 significant digits. From number 1 to 20,000 and scientists quickly adopted the new labor-saving tool for tedious calculations. It was a very important turn in calculating devices. 
    <h4>Calculating clock</h4>
    In 1623 the German astronomer and mathematician Wilhelm Schickard built the first calculator. He described it in a letter to his friend the astronomer Johannes Kepler, and in 1624 he wrote again to explain that a machine he had commissioned to be built for Kepler was apparently along with the prototype, destroyed in a fire. He called it a Calculating Clock. Which modern engineers have been able to reproduce from details in his letters. Even general knowledge of the clock had been temporarily lost when Schickard and his entire family perished during the Thirty Years War. but Schickard may not have been the true inventor of the calculator. A century earlier, Leonardo da Vinci sketched plans for calculator that were sufficiently complete and correct for modern engineers to build calculator on their basic.
    <h4>Pascaline</h4>
    Later in 1642 and 1644 a French mathematician-philosopher Blaise Pascal invents the Pascaline it could only do addition and subtraction, that why it also called as arithmetic machine.It worked when we rotate the wheel in clockwise direction; it added the numbers and subtracted when we rotated it counterclockwise. He made the machine for his dad. He was the tax collector. Then he built 50 of them in the next 10 years. 
    <h4>Step reckoner</h4>
    Later in 1671 the German mathematician-philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Liebniz designed a calculating machine called step Reckoner. The step reckoner expanded on pascal’s ideas and did multiplication by repeated addition like when we want to multiply 5 by 3 we add 5 3 times this is how it worked. He was also a strong advocate of the binary number system, binary numbers are ideal for machines because they require only two digits,  which can be easily represented by the on and off  states of switch. When computers became electronic, the binary system was partially appropriate because an electrical circuit is either on or off; this means that on could be represented as true, off could be represented false, and the flow of current represents false , and the flow of current would represent the flow of logic.
    <h4>Arithmometer</h4>
    Later in the 1820s Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar of France built Arithmomer, the 1st commercial mass-produced calculating device. It could do 4 of arithmetic operations; it was extremely popular and sold for 90 years. It was the size of a desktop.
    <h4>Jacquard loom</h4>
    Then later in 1804-1805 the jacquard loom was invented by Joseph-Marrie jacquard.  used punched cards to control the weaving patterns. This method of automatically issuing machine instructions was invented to form the complex patterns without human involvement and this is how it is known as the programmable device. By feeding the instruction in the form of a punched card. 
    <h4>difference engine</h4> 
    Later in 1820s the the english mathematician charles babbage known as the father of computing an he was also a founding member of Royal Astronomical society he knew the need of the automated calculating devices, then he began by writing a letter to humphry davy he was the president of Royal society it was about automating the construction of mathematical tables and specially logarithmic tables for use in navigation, then he wrote the paper “on theoretical principles of the machinery for calculating tables” the it won the 1st gold medal in 1823. Tables created by humans often contained errors which could lead to life and death matters for sailors at sea. Then Babbage argued to automate the production of tables that could have higher accuracy and with this idea he gained support from the royal society and funding from the British government for the development of his difference engine obtaining one of the world's first government grants for research and technological development. Babbage was so serious about it, he hired a master machinist to set up a fireproof workshop and built a dustproof environment for testing the device. Up until then calculations were rarely carried out, more than 6 digits babbage planned to produce a 20-30 digit result then he started working on his difference engine. It used the decimal number 0-9 represented by positions on the toothed wheels, rather than the binary number system that leibniz favored. When the wheel turned 9 to 0 it caused the next wheel to advance one position just the step reckoner calculator had operated. The difference engine was more than just a simple calculator. It was far beyond simple calculators just like modern computers. It had storage that could store the data for later processing. And used soft metal to print the output. The device was designed to be room size, but it was never built, at least by the babbage because he irregularly received several government grants, and fundings. Then he had to personally bear the financial costs, and ran into multiple construction difficulties. All the design and construction ceased in 1833 when Joseph Clement, the mechanism responsible for the actual building of the machine, refused to continue unless he was prepaid. (The completed portion of the difference engine is on permanent exhibition at the science museum in london). 
    <h4>The analytical engine</h4>
    While working on the Difference engine, Babbage began to imagine ways to improve it. He worked on analytical engine until his death in 1871 this machine has to be fully program controlled automatic mechanical computer the machine was consisted of 4 components : the mill, the store, the reader and the printer these components are essential for any computers the mill was the calculating unit, the store was were the dara could be stored for prior processing and reader, printer were the input output devices. This whole machine was steam-driven. The data was entered on punched cards, using card reading technology of the jacquard loom. The instructions for calculation were also entered through the cards, another idea taken from the jacquard loom. With this the machine can be programmed and flexible than any machine back then in existence. And  his failure to generate the promised table with his Difference Engine had dampened the enthusiasm for further government funding. It was apparent to the British government that Babbage was more interested in innovation than in construction tables. The analytical engine was really fully computer. Its most revolutionary feature was the ability to change its operation by changing the instructions on punched cards. The analytical engine was the first machine that deserved to be called a computer. 
    <h4>Ada lovelace</h4>
    The distinction between computer and calculator was clear to Babbage but not apparent to most of the people in the early 19th century. With the exception of a young girl we will talk about her in my next video. Ada Lovelace went on to become the world’s only expert on the process of sequencing instructions on the punched cards that the analytical engine used. That is, she became the world’s first computer programmer.
    <h4>Tabulator</h4>
    Later in 1879, after graduating from the columbia university school of mines, new york city herman hollerith obtained his first job with one of his former professors at the census in 1880 there the hollerith saw the need of automating the statistical data. On the punched card people can store their information such as age,gender, esidance after that he founded the tabulating machine company on december 5, 1896. There were so many business companies in the US after all of them became 1 in 1911 known as CTR ( tabulating recording company ) . After 10 years CTR changed it to IBM as an international business machines corporation. After that IBM became the giant of the computer industry. 
    <h4>Differential analyzer </h4>
    Later in 1930 at MIT Vannevar Bush developed the differential analyzer to solve differential equations. 
    <h4>Howard aiken</h4>
    While Bush was working on analog computing at MIT, across town Harward professor Howard Aiken was working with digital devices for calculation. He had begun to realize in hardware something like Babbage’s Analytical Engine which he had read about. Starting in 1937 he laid out plans for a series of four calculating machines of increasing sophistication, based on different technologies, from the largely mechanical Mark 1 to the electronic Mark 4. Aiken was exploring the advances made since the mechanical assembly and steam power available to babbage. Electromagnetic relay circuits were already being used in business machines, and the vacuum tube, a switch with no moving part, very high speed action, and greater reliability than electromagnetic relays was quickly put to use in the early experimental machines. But Aiken chose not to use them for the specification of instruction. This turned out to make his machine much easier to program  than the more famous ENIAC. They had to rewrite the wirings manually for each program. From 1939 to 1944 Aiken, in collaboration with IBM developed his first fully functional computer, known as the Harward mark 1 the machine, like Babbage’s, was huge more than 50 feet long weighting in 5 tons and consisting of about 750,000 seperate parts it was mostly mechanical. For input and output it used three paper-tape readers, two card readers, a card punch, and two typewriters. It took between three and six seconds to add two numbers. Aiken developed three more such machines mark 2-4 over the next few years and is credited with developing the first fully automatic large scale calculator.
    <h4>The turing machine</h4> 
    In 1936 Alan Turing, while mathematics student at university of cambridge, was inspired by German mathematician David Hilbert’s formalism program which sought to demonstrate that any mathematical problem can be solved by an algorithm. Turing related this problem with computing machines and started to design a machine that could be capable of resolving all the mathematical problems, alan said that computing machines should not be limited only to arithmetic the computing machine can represent numbers,logical values,letters he said everything could be represented symbolically, he was the one who thought of  artificial  intelligence.
    <h4>Atanasoff-berry Computer (ABC)</h4>
    John Vincent Atanasoff, a physicist and mathematician at Iowa State College ( now Lowa State University ), during 1937-42. Together with his graduate assistant CLifford E. Berry Atanasoff built a successful small prototype in 1939 for the purpose of testing two ideas central to his design: capacitors to store data in binary form and electronic logic circuits to perform addition and subtraction. They then began the design and construction of a larger, more general-purpose computer, known as the atanasoff-berry computer or ABC. Various components of ABC were designed and built from 1939-42 but development was discontinued with the onset of World War 2. The ABC featured about 300 vacuum tubes for control and arithmetic calculations using binary numbers, logic operations, memory capacitors, and punched cards as input/output units. 
    <h4>Konrad Zuse </h4>
    Meanwhile in Germany engineer Konrad Zuse had been thinking about calculating machines. He was advised by a calculator manufacturer in 1937 that the field was dead end and that every problem had already been solved. Zuse had something else in mind though. Zuse worked in binary from the beginning; all of his prototype machines built in 1936 used binary number representation in order to simplify the construction. This had the advantage of making the connection with logic. And Zuse worked in detail on how the operation of AND OR NOT could be mapped to a computer circuit. English mathematician George Boole had shown the connection between logic and mathematics in the mid 19th century developing an algebra known as the boolean algebra. Zuse also spent more time than his predecessors and contemporaries developing software for his computer. Although all his machines were really calculators not computers his Z3 completed in december 1941 and destroyed in april 1945 during an allied air raid on berlin. 
    <h4>Development during world war 2 </h4>
    The agencies during world war gave importance and funding to computer research for example. In Britain the importance was code breaking. The ultra project was funded to develop the technology necessary to crack ciphers and codes produced by the german electromechanical devices known as the Enigma. The first machine in the series of code breaking machines was colossus mark 1 created in 1943 it consisted of approximately 1800 vacuum tubes for computations. Also Alan Turing made help during the code breaking. The colossus can be described as the first electronic digital computer and it was certainly a key stepping stone to the development of modern digital computers. 
    <h4>The Z4</h4>
    In Germany Konrad Zuse constructed the Z4 in 1943 with the funding from the air ministry. Like Z3 it also used electromechanical relays. Because of difficulty in acquiring the roughly 2000 vacuum tubes at wartime in germany. 
    <h4>ENIAC</h4>
    In united states at university of pennsylvania with government funding in 1943 the ENIAC was created ( electronic integrator numerator and computer ) it lacked some functions of colossus that would have made it more general purpose machine this machine used plugboards for communicating instructions to the machine thus it was programmed the ran at electronic speed. The disadvantage was it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem. This machine was huge and most powerful at that time. It was 15 by 9 meters, it had approximately 18,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors and 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches and 1,500 relays; it was the most complex electronic system built. It ran continuously in part to extend tube life it could do 5,000 additions per second the computer used vacuum tubes as known as the 1st generation computers. ENIAC was completed in February 1946 and cost the government 400,000 dollars. And the war it was designed to win was over. Its first task was doing calculations for the construction of a hydrogen bomb. A portion of the machine is on exhibit at the Smithsonian institute in Washington DC. 
    <h4>Towards the classical computer </h4>
    The computers built during the war were built under unusual constraints. The British work was largely focused on code breaking, the American work on the computer projectile trajectories and calculations for the atomic bomb the. After the war, efforts focused on fulfilling the idea of a general purpose computing device. In 1945, before ENIAC was even finished, planning began at the Moore school for ENiAC ‘s successor, the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer, or EDVAC. ENIAC was hampered, as all previous electronic computers had been, by the need to use one vacuum tube in a computer to store each bit, or binary digit. The feasible number of vacuum tubes in a computer also posed a practical limit on storage capacity beyond a certain point, vacuum tubes are bound to burn out as fast as they can be changed for EDVAC, Eckert had a new idea for storage. It was the mercury based delay line EDVAC could use a delay line and 10 vacuum tubes to store 1,000 bit’s. Before the invention of the magnetic  core memory and the transistor, which would eliminate the need for vacuum tubes altogether, the mercury delay line was instrumental in increasing computer storage and reliability.
    <h4>Von neumann</h4>
    But the design of the modern, or classical computer did not fully crystallize until the publication of a 1946 paper by Arthur Burks, Herman Goldstine, and John von Neumann titled “Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instruments''. And it is frequently cited on the birth certificate of computer science. Von stated that the instruction and data should be kept in a single store and that instruction should be encoded so as to be modifiable by other instructions. This was an extremely critical decision, because it meant that one program could be created as data by data by another program. Zeus had considered and rejected this possibility as too dangerous. But its inclusion by von Neumann’s group made possible high-level programming language and most of the advanced software of the following 50 years. Subsequently, computers with stored programs would be known as the von Neumann machines. One program that the stored-program idea solved was the need for the rapid access to instructions. Colossus and ENIAC had used plugboards, which had the advantage of enabling the instructions to be read in electrically, rather than by much slower mechanical card readers, but it also had the disadvantage of making these first- generation machines very hard to program. But if the instructions could be stored in the same electronic memory that held the data, they could be accessed as quickly as needed as quickly as needed. One immediate obvious consequence was that EDVAC would need a lot more memory than ENIAC. Engineers in Britain still beat the Americans to the goal of building the first stored-program digital computer. At the university of Manchester, Frederic C. Williams and Tom Kilburt built a simple stored-program computer known as the Baby in 1948 it was built to test their invention of a way to store information on a cathode-ray-tube that enable direct access ( in contrast to the mercury delay line’s sequential access ) to stored information although faster than Eckert’s storage method, by 1949 Williams and Kilburn had extended the baby to a full-size computer, the Manchester Mark 1. This had two major new features that were to become computer standards: a two-level store and instruction modification registers (which soon evolved into index registers). A magnetic drum was added to provide a random -access secondary storage device. Until machines were fitted with index registers, every instruction that referred to an address that varied as the program ran an array element had to be preceded by instruction to alter its address to the current required value. Four months after the baby first worked, the British government contracted the electronics firm of ferranti to build a production computer based on the prospective Mark 1. This became the Ferranti Mark 1. The first commercial computer of which 9 of them were sold. 
    At the university of cambridge, Maurice Wikes and others built what is recognized as the first full-size, fully electronic, stored-program computer to provide a formal computing service for users. The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) was built on the set of principles synthesized by von Neumann and like the Manchester Mark 1 , became operational in 1949. Wikes built the machines chiefly to study programming issues which he realized would become as important as the hardware details.
    <h4>UNIVAC</h4>
    After leaving the Moore school, Eckart and Mauchly struggles to obtain capital to build their latest design, a computer they called the Universal Automatic Computer, or UNIVAC. (in the meantime, they contracted with the Northrop Corporation to build the Binary Automatic Computer, or BINAC, which, when completed in 1949, became the first American stored-program computer,) The partners delivered the first UNIVAC to the U.S bureau of the Census in march 1951, by Remington Rand, inc in 1950. Although it owed something to experience with ENIAC, UNIVAC was built from the start as a stored-program computer, so it was a really different architecture. It used an operator keyboard and console typewriter for input and magnetic tape for all other input and output. Printed output was recorded on tape and then printed by a separate tape printer. After WW2 in 1945,primarily in the United States and Britain. These projects were inspired chiefly by a 1946 document, “Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Digital Computing Instrument '' produced by a group working under the direction of mathematician John von Neumann of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. The IAS paper, as von Neumann’s document became known, articulated the concept of the stored  program, a concept that has been called the simple largest innovation in the history of the computer. 
    <h4>Modern computing</h4>
    Business use at this time was marginal because the machines were so hard to use. Although computer makers such as Remington Rand, the Burroughs Adding Machines COmpany, and IBM had begun building machines to the IAS specifications, it was not until 1954 that a real market for business computers began to emerge . The IBM 650, delivered at the end of 1954 for colleges and business, was a decimal implementation of the IAS design. With this low-cost magnetic drum computer, which sold for about 200,00 apice (compared with about 1,000,000 for the scientific model, by offering universities that taught computer science courses around the IBM 650 an academic discount program (with price reduction of up to percent), IBM established a cadre of engineers and programmers for their machines (Apple later used a similar discount strategy in American grade school to capture a large proportion of the early microcomputer market.)
    The machines of the early 1950s were not much more capable than CHarles Babbage’s Analytical Engine  of the 1830s (although they were much faster). Although in principle these were general-purpose computers, they were still largely restricted to doing tough math problems. They often lacked the means to perform logical operations, and they had little text-handling capability-for example, lowercase letters were not even representable in the machines, even if there were devices capable of printing them. These machines could be operated only by experts, and preparing a problem for computation (what would be called programming today) took a long time. With only one person at a time able to use a machine, major bottlenecks were created. Problems lined up like experiments waiting for a cyclotron or the space shuttle. Much of the machine’s precious time was wasted because of this one at-a-time protocol. In sum, the machines were expensive and the market was still small. To be useful in a broader business market or even a broader scientific market, and so on. These are application programs, word processors, database programs, and so on. These applications in turn would require programming languages in which to write them and operating systems to manage them.
